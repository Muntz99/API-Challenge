In reviewing the weather data there were a couple of clear obserable trends seen. 

The first was that the further  you got from the Equater, traveling either North or South, the lower the Max temperature typically was.

Second was that, despite the variance in distance from the Equater in both Norther and Southern Hemisphere, the Humidity levels remained fairly consistant across all Latitudes. The majority remaining the the 60%-100% Humidity range.

Third, based on the cities sampled, was that the windspeed was more greatly affected by latitdude in the Souther Hemisphere but overall remained pretty consistant for the sample given. The Norther Hemisphere mostly remained in the 0-10 mph range while in the Souther Hemisphere the average wind speeds were much more spread out. This is likely due to the sampling of cities randomly being pulled having less result found in the Southern Hemisphere to compare.
